# Python Camunda SDK

This is an implementation of Camunda SDK in Python built on top of the [pyzeebe](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/pyzeebe).

It simplifies definitions of outbound and inbound connectors and utilises [pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) for data validation.

See [Quick start](quick_start.md) to get started and [API](api.md) for usage.
